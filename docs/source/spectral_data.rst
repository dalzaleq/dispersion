The SpectralData Class
======================

Spectral data is use to define data with an associated spectrum. Typically objects of
this class will be generated by a parent MaterialData class which handles one or more spectral data
classes in order to provide both real and imaginary parts of optical parameters.

SpectralData can be instanced as one of three subclasses: Constant, Interpolation or Model.

Constant
--------

This defines data which is independent of the associated spectrum and therefore has a constant
value.

Interpolation
-------------

Allows for the interpolation of tabulated data.

Model
-----

An abstract base class for the different models implimented in the package. Currently
supported models are:

**Sellmeier**
    implements the Sellmeier model for refractive index
**Sellmeier2**
    implements the modified Sellmeier model for refractive index
**Polynomial**
    implements a polynomial model for refractive index
**RefractiveIndexInfo**
    implements the RefractiveIndexInfo model for refractive index
**Cauchy**
    implements the Cauchy model for refractive index
**Gases**
    implements the Gas model for refractive index
**Herzberger**
    implements the Herzberger model for refractive index
**Retro**
    implements the Retro model for refractive index
**Exotic**
    implements the Exotic model for refractive index
**Drude**
    implements the Drude model for complex permittivity
**DrudeLorentz**
    implements the Drude-Lorentz model for complex permittivity

Extrapolation
-------------

Extends a SpectralData object to spectral values outside of the originally defined
range.
