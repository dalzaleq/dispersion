=======
The refractive_index_database package keeps different literature databases internally
separate as so called Modules. This page lists the currently available modules.

The user data is the only module that is installed by default. It is empty apart from
example file types. This is where the user can place their own files.

The refractive index database hosted at `refractive index info`_ is made freely
available via their `github project`_.

.. _refractive index info: https://refractiveindex.info/
